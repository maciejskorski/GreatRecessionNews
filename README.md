# Great Recession News Corpus

## Overview

Reconstructed  "Great Recession News" Corpus, described in "Building the Great Recession News Corpus (GRNC): A contemporary diachronic corpus of economy news in English" (Research in Corpus Linguistics, 2020).

The authors don't share the source data and the corpus can be only interacted through paid plans of Sketch Engine.

This repository offers an alternative by publishing digital identifiers (urls) of the documents used in the corpus. 
In addition, it demonstrates how to download the data for non-commerical purposes from public websites or through developers API.

## Data Description

SketchEngine processed 18,915 articles from "The Guardian" and 13,069 articles from "New York Times".
There are some redundancies in the data, not mentioned in the original paper. The urls retrieved in this repo perfectly match what is available at SketchEngine.
